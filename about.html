									<dt>Basics?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Hi, I'm Anmol. I was born in Bombay, but now I stay in Delhi, India. My pronouns are he/him/his.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Work?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I'm a freelance web developer. In simpler terms, I started learning something I liked and now make a lil dough on the side by helping companies piece together websites.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Politics?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I always agree with the side that isn't discrimatory, so none as of now. Maybe that'll change. All I know is, I got my morals and ethics in the right place. </p>
										</dd>
									<dt>What do you admire in people?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Passion. People who have things in their lives that make their eyes light up brighter than the moon when they talk about it, those are the kind of humans I love.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Biggest fear?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Not achieving the things that I know and don't know I'm capable of.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Biggest pet peeve?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>People that talk too much and do too little. After a point, the talk should stop and the actions should speak.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Why this journal?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I've realised that writing about something helps me interalise it. I'm on a life-long journey of self improvement and If somehow you stumble upon this particular website, I want you to gain something from it. I'll be sharing insights here about everything I learn, be it from work, working out, people, experiences, etc. My grandfather used to say, "Life is a buffet, pick whatever you like and move on. There's something you can learn from everyone, don't be stupid, never let your ego get in the way of learning."</p>

										<blockquote>Anmol, what can I say, he's like the Mona Lisa, someone that stands the test of time and remains youthful about it. He is the only person that can be so completely sexy in every single way. Like seriously, he's perfect. I stare at his ass all day, I smile when he smiles, I laugh when he laughs. I love being around him, he's one of the most warm people I've met. So humble, never brags at all, I found out he flew a Cessna 172 but not because he told me, but because I asked him. Wonderful character, great person to meet with, great set of washboard abs. 14/10 would recommend</blockquote>
